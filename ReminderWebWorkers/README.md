JavaScript reminder program that sends self reminder messages using web workers (so we can get around single-threaded nature of JavaScript).

Experimenting with various HTML5 tags.

Using jQuery UI accordion to show all reminders.

Simple python server needed because security exception in chrome browser prevents opening html/javascript files as file: protocol, needs http localhost instead
